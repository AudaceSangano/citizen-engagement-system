# üèõÔ∏è Citizen Engagement System (MVP)

This is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a **Citizen Engagement System**, designed to streamline how citizens submit complaints or feedback about public services and how government institutions respond.

## Project Overview

Currently, complaints are often handled through fragmented channels, resulting in delayed responses and poor citizen satisfaction. This system provides a centralized platform to:

- Submit complaints or feedback online
- Automatically categorize and route complaints to the appropriate agency
- Track complaint status
- Enable institutions to respond via an admin interface

## Key Features

- **Complaint Submission** via a simple web form
- **Categorization and Auto-Routing** to relevant government agencies
- **Status Tracking** so users can follow up on their complaint
- **Admin Dashboard** to manage complaints and respond
- **Authentication System** for both Citizens and Admins
